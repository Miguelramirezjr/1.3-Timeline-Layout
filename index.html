  <p><h5>These are a southern heirloom favorite and are quite a bit more expensive to grow. We like to include as many as we can afford to into the CSA. They are a green and purple pod when young and a dark purple pod when dried on the vine. Both are edible. You will want to shell all the dried dark purple pods you see. The pods that are still green and purple you will want to use those as snap peas and cook them as you would a green bean. They both take time to shell and some of the members love it and some don’t like taking the time to shell them. They do take some time and you don’t get a lot when your finished. They also take an incredible amount of time for us to pick by hand, but we feel it is worth the effort.
         We still love them and I personally just shell what I can and put them in the freezer. They are a wonderful addition to soups in the winter. </h5></p></div>

  <p><h5>I have been making this for over a year now. My family loves it. For all those people who give it less than 3 stars, try again with these instructions I learned from past reviewers. Use 1/3 cup. Wow! I'd give this 10 stars if I could! Hands down THE juiciest chicken I’ve ever eaten. I generally hate white meat but decided to stick to the recipe here and used boneless breast filets.</h5></p>
