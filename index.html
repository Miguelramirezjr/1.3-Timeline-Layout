      <p>Turn the heat down to medium, add the onion and garlic and saut√© until softened, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and the red pepper flakes. Add the white wine, lemon juice and chicken broth, and bring to a simmer. Scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 2 minutes, then add the chicken back into the pan, and simmer for 1 more minute or until the liquid is reduced by half. Stir in the butter to melt. Add the parsley and the pasta and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil before serving.</p>
